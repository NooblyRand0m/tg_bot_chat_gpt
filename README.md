This bot allows you to use OpenAI API to generate text responses to user requests. To use the bot, simply send a command "/gpt" followed by your request. The bot will generate a response using OpenAI API's text generation capabilities and send it back to you.

To use this bot, you will need to set up the following:

A Telegram bot token. You can obtain this by creating a new bot through the BotFather on Telegram.

An OpenAI API key. You can obtain this by signing up for OpenAI's GPT-3 beta program.

A list of greetings to randomly choose from when responding to user requests. This can be customized to your needs by modifying the "greetings.txt" file.

Once you have set up the prerequisites, you can run the bot by executing the Python script. The bot will listen for user requests and generate responses using OpenAI API's text generation capabilities.
